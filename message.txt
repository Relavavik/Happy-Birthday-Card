On this day, I wish you a very happy and prosperous life
I also wish that May Allah grant your every wish, accept every prayer
May Allah also help you find light in the darkness, 
I hope that one day you reach your full potential and be the best version of yourself you can be
I may or may not be there
You may or may not remember me
But my good wishes will always be with you
I am not really good with luck but I believe destiny with the fact that you write your own destiny
So I won't say that I got you as my sister 
But I will say, 
Thank you for choosing me as your brother

Have I got a brotherly advice for you? 

Well I got a couple of them
1. Be careful about what you choose
2. Don't feel bad for your mistakes, Everyone one makes mistakes instead focus on how you can be better
And Take pride for your right decisions
And one more thing
3. Don't be afraid of what's ahead of you and remember the ones that love you will always be there for you


Wishing you a very happy birthday
